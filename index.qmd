title: Introduction to Data Science
subtitle: Practical Session for MSc Students
---

Welcome to this practical introduction to data science! This session is designed for MSc students at the Institute for Transport Studies who are new to data science.

## About This Session

In this practical, you'll get hands-on experience with data science tools. We'll cover implementations primarily in **R**. **Python** versions of the contents are provided, take your pick!

## Languages

<details>
<summary>Which language should I use?</summary>

There are a number of languages that can be used for data science, including JavaScript/TypeScript, Julia, and MATLAB. However, the two most popular languages are **R** and **Python**. Both are excellent choices for data science, and each has its own strengths, as outlined below.

## R vs Python

If you are unsure which language to pick, we recommend trying both for 10 minutes to see which one "clicks" for you.

**Why choose R?**

-   **"Batteries included":** Base R has built-in support for data frames, reading data from URLs, and statistical models (like linear regression) without needing extra packages.
-   **RStudio IDE:** The premier environment for R is user-friendly and often feels familiar to those coming from MATLAB.
-   **Stability:** You are less likely to encounter "dependency hell" because CRAN enforces strict checks on package compatibility.
-   **Community:** R has a massive community specifically focused on statistics and data visualization.

**Why choose Python?**

-   **General Purpose:** Python is used for everything from web development to automation, not just data science.
-   **Deep Learning:** It is the industry standard for machine learning and AI frameworks (like `pytorch` and `openai`).
-   **Readability:** Python syntax is designed to be very readable and close to English.
